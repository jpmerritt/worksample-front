#High Horse - Front End Challenge.

Prepared by James Merritt.

##### Why a worksample?
A work sample mirrors as closely as possible the work you will do every day at High Horse. In this case working with API's and using React and Redux to create flawless products from a style guide. This is our most important tool for evaluating your experience and your professional fit at the company.

##### What we are looking for:
At High Horse we work exclusively with startups to create bold, impactful and disruptive digital products. We're looking for engineers who are passionate product makers, who care about creating intuitive and beautful interfaces and of course, lovers of all things javascript. In this challenge you should show us your attention to detail and your ability to write correct, well organised and readable code.
 

##### How to submit:
Once you've completed the challenge, commit your code to a GitHub repo and send the link to worksample@highhorse.agency along with your name. We'll get back to you and go through your solution together in a subsequent interview.

The challenge is designed to be completed in 2-4 hours. Whatever you submit should be runable.
